1) Add a square photo of your helper to 'images/'. Preferably not bigger than 400 by 400 pixels and a jpg (I know, pngs are great, but they take incredibly long to load.)
(you might need to clone the Repo first to be able to do this.)

2) Copy the following template into the right spot and replace all the fields that are written in capitals!

<ul class="flex-container_row">
  <li>
  	<img class="flex-item-image tt_target" id="FIRSTNAME" src="images/IMAGE.png" alt="FIRSTNAME">
  </li>
  <li class="flex-item-description">
  	<a href="https://twitter.com/TWITTERNAME"> FULL NAME </a> </br>
	Tools: TOOLS </br>
	Specialties: SPECIALTIES </li>
</ul> 

3) Add the following below "<!-- 	ADD BADGES HERE -->"

		<div id="FIRSTNAME_badges" style="display:inline-block;"> 
		<img src="images/B_swcinstructor.png"> </br>
		<img src="images/B_trainer.png">
